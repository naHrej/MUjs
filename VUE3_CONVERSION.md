# Vue 3 Conversion Complete!

## What Changed

The entire application has been successfully converted from Vue 2 (CDN version) to Vue 3 with a modern build system using Vite.

### Key Changes Made:

1. **Build System**: 
   - Added Vite as the bundler for modern, fast builds
   - Replaced CDN Vue scripts with proper module imports
   - Configured for Electron integration

2. **Vue 3 Conversion**:
   - Converted all components from Options API to Composition API
   - Updated to use `createApp()` instead of `new Vue()`
   - Modernized component structure with proper `<script setup>` syntax

3. **Component Structure**:
   - `SiteManager.vue` - Manages connection sites with Vue 3 reactive system
   - `Terminal.vue` - Handles terminal connections and data display
   - `Settings.vue` - Application settings management
   - `Editor.vue` - Monaco code editor integration

4. **Module System**:
   - All JavaScript is now properly modularized
   - Uses ES6 imports/exports throughout
   - Better separation of concerns

├── editor.js         # Editor app entry point  
├── settings.js       # Settings app entry point

├── preload/         # Electron preload scripts
└── render/          # Legacy render files (being phased out)

dist/                # Built files (generated)
public/              # HTML templates and static assets
vite.config.js       # Vite build configuration
```

## Development Commands

- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run dev:watch` - Build in watch mode for development
- `npm start` - Build and start Electron app
- `npm run electron:dev` - Start Electron without building (if already built)

## Benefits of the New System

1. **Modern Development**: Vue 3 Composition API provides better TypeScript support and more flexible component organization
2. **Better Performance**: Vite's build system is significantly faster than webpack
3. **Tree Shaking**: Unused code is automatically removed from the final bundle
4. **Hot Module Replacement**: Faster development cycles with instant updates
5. **Better Node Integration**: Can now use Vue 3 compatible Node.js packages
6. **Type Safety**: Ready for TypeScript migration if desired

## Monaco Editor Integration

The Monaco Editor is now properly integrated with Vue 3:
- Full IntelliSense and code completion
- Multiple language support (MOOCode, JavaScript, TypeScript, etc.)
- Proper theme integration
- Event handling through Vue 3 composition API

## Node Package Compatibility

The app can now use modern Vue 3 compatible packages:
- @guolao/vue-monaco-editor for advanced editor features
- Any Vue 3 UI library (Vuetify, PrimeVue, etc.)
- Modern state management solutions (Pinia instead of Vuex)
- Better testing frameworks (Vitest, Vue Testing Library)

## Next Steps (Optional Improvements)

1. **TypeScript Migration**: Convert to TypeScript for better type safety
2. **State Management**: Add Pinia for centralized state management
3. **Testing**: Add unit tests with Vitest
4. **UI Library**: Consider adding a Vue 3 UI framework
5. **Dev Tools**: Better development experience with Vue DevTools 3

The application now has a modern foundation that will be much easier to maintain and extend!
